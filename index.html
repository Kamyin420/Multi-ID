    <h1> Embrace Your Hybrid Identity. </h1>
        <p class="tekst1">At i-D, we believe in the power of identity that cannot 
            be boxed into one category. Our newly revamped Multi i-D cultural 
            section is committed to providing a platform for those who live 
            between worlds, people whose identities are shaped by multiple cultures, 
            languages, and experiences. We See You is not just a campaign; it’s a 
            celebration of the complexity and richness of hybrid identities. </p>
            <p class="tekst2"> 
                This campaign is the beginning of something much bigger.  
                We are giving the space to those voices and stories that haven’t been 
                heard, creating a community where belonging is about embracing complexity, 
                not fitting into a predefined mold.
